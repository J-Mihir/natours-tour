## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A local or remote MongoDB database instance.
- API keys for Stripe, Mapbox, and an email service like SendGrid.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/J-Mihir/natours-tour.git](https://github.com/J-Mihir/natours-tour.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd natours-tour
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Rename the `config.env.example` file to `config.env` and add your own configuration values for the database, JWT secret, email credentials, and API keys.
    ```env
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE=your_mongodb_connection_string
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
    JWT_SECRET=a-long-and-very-secure-secret-string
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
    # ... and so on for email, Stripe, etc.
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
For development, you need to run two processes in two separate terminals: the Node.js server and the Parcel bundler.

1.  **Start the Node.js server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  **In a new terminal, start the Parcel bundler:** This will watch your frontend files and automatically rebuild the `bundle.js` file when you make changes.
    ```bash
    npm run watch:js
    ```
3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
